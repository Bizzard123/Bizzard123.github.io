      <p>The rapid advancement of technology and digitalization is fundamentally altering the world, bringing about unprecedented changes and disruptions. Our aim is to assist you in adapting swiftly and capitalizing on the opportunities that arise from digital transformation.</p>
      <p>Microsoft SharePoint is a collaboration and document management platform that helps your organization’s productivity.</p>
      <p>Organizations subscribed to Microsoft 365 benefit from a plethora of productivity tools, among which SharePoint stands out as the most intelligent and customizable. With millions of users across over 200,000 organizations of varying sizes, SharePoint streamlines operations by consolidating various tasks and project management platforms, ultimately saving time.</p>
      <p>SharePoint has many amazing, advanced functionalities that can help you or your team manage professional and personal work. The following are some of the most frequently used features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>File sharing with internal as well as external users.</li>
        <li>Managing project content such as images, articles, source codes, videos, and so on.</li>
        <li>Sites and subsites for decluttering teams and tasks.</li>
        <li>Staying in touch with the collaborator through communication sites.</li>
        <li>Creating workflows and reminders in order to automate projects and tasks.</li>
        <li>Using the search function to look for resources, tasks, or files.</li>
        <li>The mobile app allows users to access team or communication sites from smartphones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Benefits of SharePoint</h2>
      <p>SharePoint offers many benefits when compared with any other productivity tool for a project or content management. Some of these advantages include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Saving Money:</strong> You may already be paying for it through a Microsoft 365 subscription. Avoid unnecessary spending on apps and tools by using SharePoint as the primary productivity tool for professional or personal needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The scalability of the tool allows you to budget your cost towards productivity tools. If you see an inflow of too many projects from different clients, you can change the subscription to accommodate more resources and projects. When projects ease off, you can switch to low-paid plans.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Governments and big organizations trust the SharePoint ecosystem with their sensitive data. So, you can store your creative work on SharePoint for collaborative work without any fear of intellectual property theft.</li>
        <li><strong>Multipurpose Usage:</strong> A higher level of flexibility and multipurpose utility means that you can keep using SharePoint as the principal productivity tool while you keep changing your roles or creative skills. You can use a template when one project ends, and you need to start another one. The budget can be minimized by avoiding multiple app purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> As a business leader, how many hours per week do you think you spend digging through the archives to find a file? Whether you’re searching inside of a filing cabinet or clicking through an endless sea of folders, it can be mind-numbing and frustrating to devote time during the busy workday to a wild goose chase.</li>
      </ul>
